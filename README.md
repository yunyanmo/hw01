## Biography of Yunyan Mo

My name is Yunyan Mo. I usually ask people to just call me *Yan* because it is easier to prounce than my full name and will allieviate the inconviniences and embarassments one might feel when I was first introduced to him/her. 

Given my unique name, it is not hard to deduce where did I come from. I was born and raise in **Guangdong, China**. It is a beautiful southern province. If you want to learn more about my hometown, you can visit [this link.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong)

I enjoy reading, drawing, and watching movies. Here are some movies that I plan to watch over the summer:
* Thelma and Louise
* Paprika
* 2001: A Space Odyssey
* Baryy Lyndon
* Loving Vincent
* Memoirs of a Geisha

![This is me in Kyoto, Japan, I look forward to the day when we can travel around the world freely again.](/Users/wowowo/Desktop/Me.jpeg)

I am *excited* about this course and when I am going to learn for the next 5 weeks! I will try my **best** to be a good student!
